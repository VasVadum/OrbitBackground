	<description>A very simple mod that changes the wallpaper to the main menu of Rimworld, does nothing else at all. I felt that the crashed ship effect was a little odd, it looked like a crashed ship on the planet instead of something that exploded in orbit. I have the source file for the image so I may make future tweaks later on as well based on input here.</description>
